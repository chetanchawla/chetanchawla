I am a 24 year old Engineer from India who loves space and exoplanets. I am currently a research intern at Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Taiwan, working on finding Exoplanet candidates using the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), under the supervision of Dr. Alex Teachey. Previously, I worked as a Data Analyst at ZS Associates.
